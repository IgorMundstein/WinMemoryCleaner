  <p align="justify">
    This free RAM cleaner uses native Windows features to clear memory areas. Sometimes, programs do not release the allocated memory, making the computer slow. That is when you use Windows Memory Cleaner to optimize the memory, so you can keep working without wasting time restarting your system. 
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    It's portable, so you do not need installation or configuration. Download and open the executable to get started. The app requires administrator privileges and has a minimalistic interface and smart features.

## üöÄ Features

### Auto optimization

- `Every X hours` - The optimization will run by period. 0h disables it.
- `When free memory is below X percent` - The optimization will run if free memory is below the specified percentage. 0% disables it.

### Memory Areas

- `Clean Combined Page List` - Flushes blocks from the combined page list. Effective only when page combining is enabled.
- `Clean Modified Page List` - Flushes memory from the Modified page list, writing unsaved data to disk and moving the pages to the Standby list.
- `Clean Processes Working Set` - Removes memory from all user-mode and system working sets and moves it to the Standby or Modified page lists. Note that by the time, processes that run any code will necessarily populate their working sets to do so.
- `Clean Standby List` - Flushes pages from all Standby list to the Free list.
- `Clean Standby List (Low Priority)` - Flushes pages from the lowest-priority Standby list to the Free list.
- `Clean System Working Set` - Removes memory from the system cache working set.
