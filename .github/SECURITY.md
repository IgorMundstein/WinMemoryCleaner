# Security Policy

Hey there! Thanks for checking out WinMemoryCleaner and caring about security.

## Reporting Security Issues

Even if you’re not sure it’s a real vulnerability, I’d rather hear from you than miss something important.

**If you notice a potential security problem, please:**
- **Email me directly at [igor.mundstein@gmail.com](mailto:igor.mundstein@gmail.com) for sensitive issues.**  
- You may also [use the “Report a security vulnerability” button on GitHub](../../security/advisories/new) if available, or
- As a last resort, open an issue on this repo (please do **not** include sensitive details in public issues).

I aim to respond to security reports within **72 hours**.

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the latest version (main branch) is maintained and gets security updates.

## Disclosure Preference

If you find something sensitive, please avoid posting details publicly at first. Give me a chance to fix it—I'll try to respond and patch quickly.

## General Advice

- Download only from the official GitHub releases page.
- Don’t trust unofficial builds.

## License

WinMemoryCleaner is open source under the GPL-3. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
